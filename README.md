# Port Scanner

This repository contains a Python script for scanning open TCP ports on a target IP address. The script uses the `scapy` library to craft and send network packets, implementing a basic SYN scan to determine which ports are open.

## Features
- Sends SYN packets to a range of ports on a target IP.
- Detects open ports by analyzing SYN-ACK responses.
- Sends RST packets to gracefully close connections for identified open ports.
- Scans the first 1024 common TCP ports by default.

## How It Works
1. **SYN Packet Transmission**: The script sends a TCP SYN packet to each specified port on the target IP.
2. **Response Analysis**: If the target responds with a SYN-ACK packet, the port is marked as open.
3. **Connection Closure**: An RST packet is sent to close the connection after identifying an open port.
4. **Result Compilation**: All open ports are stored in a list and displayed to the user after the scan is complete.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `scapy` library installed

## Installation
Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VladSerbu-tech/Scapy.git
cd <repository-directory>
```

Install the required library:
```bash
pip install scapy
```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
```bash
python port_scanner.py
```

### Example Output
```bash
Enter the target IP: 192.168.1.1
Scanning 192.168.1.1 for open ports...
Open ports found: [22, 80, 443]
```

### Script Breakdown
#### `scan_ports` Function
- **Input**:
  - `target` (string): Target IP address to scan.
  - `ports` (iterable): Range of port numbers to scan.
- **Output**:
  - `open_ports` (list): List of open ports.
- **Logic**:
  - For each port in the specified range, a TCP SYN packet is sent.
  - Responses are analyzed to identify open ports (those that reply with SYN-ACK).
  - RST packets are sent to terminate connections gracefully.

#### Main Program
- Accepts user input for the target IP.
- Scans ports 1 through 1024 by default.
- Prints a summary of open ports, if any.
